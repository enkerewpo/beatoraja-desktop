# Launch script for beatoraja.app.
#
# This calls the JRE inside the bundle directly instead of using the jpackage launcher:
#   1. jpackage cannot set a working directory, and Finder starts apps with CWD=/, so
#      relative paths in core (font/VL-Gothic-Regular.ttf, skin/default/select.json)
#      all miss. Java cannot chdir, so the directory has to be right before the JVM starts.
#   2. The jpackage launcher looks up its .cfg by its own filename, so renaming it to slot a
#      wrapper in front breaks it. Its classpath and internal-file resolution also differ
#      from plain java: with the same installation directory, gradle run works while the
#      jpackage launcher reports missing files.
# Calling java ourselves keeps the classpath, working directory and JVM flags identical to
# the development setup.
